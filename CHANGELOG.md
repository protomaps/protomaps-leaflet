# 3.0.0

* Unexport `PMTiles` because you shouldn't be depending on the one bundled in this library.
* Bump `pmtiles` dependency to v3.x
* package.json defaults to ES6.
* remove CubicBezier function as no longer used.

# 2.0.0

Major version 2.0 aggressively reduces the scope of this rendering library.

This library re-focuses on being a Leaflet plugin for vector tile basemaps, i.e. "Mapnik in the browser"

* **All user interaction features are removed.** Every mapping application with clickable features should use MapLibre GL JS.

* **MapLibre JSON style compatibility is removed.** The surface area of the JSON style is too large to maintain for real-world use cases, and styles written for MapLibre perform poorly with this library.

* **Programmatic shading and extra basemap styles are removed.** This library's default style aligns with the 5 MapLibre styles developed in protomaps/basemaps.

* `levelDiff` is no longer configurable and defaults to 1 to match MapLibre GL.

* consistent camelCase naming e.g. `paint_rules` -> `paintRules`

* You must pass one of the default basemap themes `light, dark, white, black, grayscale`. remove `dark` and `shade` options.

* Remove WebKit vertex count workaround.

* remove `PolygonLabelSymbolizer` as it is not accurate for tiled rendering.

* `maxDataZoom` defaults to 15.

* Use Protomaps basemap tileset v3 instead of v2. 

* remove `setDefaultStyle` method.

* remove multi-language `language1`, `language2`: frontends take a single `language` parameter.
